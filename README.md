# motor-overheating-with-setpoints
It is necessary to develop a console application that calculates and displays the time, which will pass from the start of the internal combustion engine to the moment of its overheating, in depending on the set ambient temperature. The application must accept console user input ambient temperature in degrees Celsius, and output on the console time to overheat in seconds. Calculate time accurately, analytically necessary, interested in obtaining this time by simulation (of course, in this way time will be calculated with a certain error).
